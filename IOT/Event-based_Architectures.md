# Event-Based Architectures

The interrupt mechanism can be exploited to design high-level event-based architectures.
- Interrupts can be conceived as low-level events interrupting the control flow of the super-loop to execute the corresponding interrupt (event) handlers.
- Interrupts make it possible to avoid polling when managing sensors and input.

High-level event-based architectures:
- Observer pattern
- Asynchronous FSM

## Observer pattern

Elements:
- **source** or generator of events:
	- it provides an interface/API for observers (listeners) to register/subscribe in order to be notified when an event occurs
- **events** generated
- **observer** (or listener) of a source
	- it provides an interface/API to be notified of the events

Designing an implementation using interrupts:
- used inside source components, bound to events that can occur
- the interrupt handler calls the listeners registered on the source component

## Asynchronous FSMs

Exploiting interrupts to design and implement event-triggered FSMs:
- defferently from synchronous FSMs, the evaluation of reactions is done when an event occurs, generated by an interrupt
- there is no notion of period
- we can eventually model/simulate a periodic behaviour by means of temporal events generated by a timer.
